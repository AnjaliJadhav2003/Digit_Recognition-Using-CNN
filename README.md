# Digit_Recognition-Using-CNN
Digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves training a model to identify and classify handwritten or machine-printed digits (0-9) from images, leveraging CNN's ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features. Convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) can be used to predict Handwritten Digits reasonably. 

# Installatation :

1. Install Necessary Libraries :
First, you need to install the required libraries. The primary libraries for this project will be TensorFlow or Keras (which is part of TensorFlow), along with NumPy, and Matplotlib for visualizing data.

          pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

2. Import Libraries :
In Python, import the necessary libraries :

       import tensorflow as tf
       from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
       import numpy as np
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

3. Load the MNIST Dataset : The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. It is conveniently available in TensorFlow/Keras.

4. Preprocess the Data :
Before passing the data to the CNN, reshape the images to have the proper dimensions and add the color channel (since the images are grayscale, they have one color channel).

5. Build the CNN Model :
Now, let's build the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The architecture will have:

       1. Conv2D layers to extract features from the images
    
       2. MaxPooling2D layers to reduce dimensionality and retain important features.
    
       3. Flatten layer to convert 2D matrices into 1D vector.

       4. Dense layer to output predictions.

       5. Softmax output layer to classify the images into one of the 10 classes (digits 0-9).

 6. Compile the Model : Once the model is built, you need to compile it. For digit recognition, we will use the categorical cross-entropy 
                        loss and the Adam optimizer.

 7. Train the Model : Now you can train the model on the MNIST training data. We’ll also set the number of epochs and the batch size.

 8. Evaluate the Model : After training, evaluate the performance of the model on the test dataset.

 9. Visualize Training Results : To better understand how the model performed, plot the training and validation accuracy over the epochs.

 10. Make Predictions : After training, you can use the model to make predictions on new data.

 11. Save the Model (Optional) : If you’re satisfied with your model, you can save it for later use.
