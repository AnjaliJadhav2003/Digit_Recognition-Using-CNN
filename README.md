# Digit_Recognition-Using-CNN
Digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves training a model to identify and classify handwritten or machine-printed digits (0-9) from images, leveraging CNN's ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features. Convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) can be used to predict Handwritten Digits reasonably.
